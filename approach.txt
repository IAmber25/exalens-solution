To solve this problem, you can iterate through each block and check the distance to the nearest required building. You can do this by keeping track of the minimum distance to a required building seen so far, and updating it whenever a block is found that is closer to a required building. Then, you can return the index of the block that resulted in the minimum distance.

Sample Input
blocks = [
{
    "gym": false,
    "school": true,
    "store": false,
},
{
    "gym": true,
    "school": false,
    "store": false,
},
{
    "gym": true,
    "school": true,
    "store": false,
},
{
    "gym": false,
    "school": true,
    "store": false,
},
{
"gym": false,
"school": true,
"store": true,
}
]
reqs = ["gym", "school", "store"]


This function should return 3 for the given input.
